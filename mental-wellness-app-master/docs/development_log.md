### Face Detection Feature Status
- Current Issue: "Start Detection" button is not clickable
- Root Cause: File loading issues with MediaPipe face detection model
- Files Present:
  - face_detection_solution_wasm_bin.wasm (5.4MB)
  - face_detection_solution_wasm_bin.js (260KB)
- Files Missing:
  - face_detection_short.binarypb
  - face_detection_short_range.tflite
- Current Configuration:
  - Using locally hosted files
  - Added detailed logging for debugging
  - Reverted from CDN loading to local file loading

### Voice Chatbot Feature Planning
- Requirements:
  - Voice input/output interface
  - Integration with existing GPTs API
  - Real-time conversation flow
  - RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) support
- Technical Components:
  - Speech-to-Text (STT) for voice input
  - Text-to-Speech (TTS) for voice output
  - WebSocket for real-time communication
  - GPT API integration
  - RAG system integration
- Implementation Steps:
  1. Set up basic chat interface
  2. Implement voice input/output
  3. Integrate with GPT API
  4. Add RAG support
  5. Implement conversation flow
  6. Add error handling and fallbacks

### Voice Chatbot Implementation
- Components Created:
  - VoiceChatbot.tsx: Main UI component
  - voiceChatService.ts: Service layer for API integration
- Features Implemented:
  - Basic UI with chat interface
  - Voice recording functionality
  - Audio playback
- Pending Implementation:
  - Speech-to-Text integration
  - GPT API integration
  - Text-to-Speech integration
  - RAG system integration
- Dependencies Added:

  - axios: For API requests
  - @types/react-icons: TypeScript definitions

### Next Steps
1. Implement STT service integration
2. Set up GPT API connection
3. Add TTS functionality
4. Integrate RAG system
5. Test end-to-end conversation flow
